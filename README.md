## Description

A package for the [Atom](https://atom.io/) text editor.

This package allows you to randomize the letters of a selected word.

## How it works

Once installed, you don't have much to do : select a word, hit `Ctrl+Alt+O` or go to `Packages > RIA Word Randomizer > Run` and voila. The letters of the selected word have been sorted in a random order.

## How to install

You can download this package from its [GitHub repository](https://github.com/TanguyScholtes/RIA-word-randomizer) or its [dedicated page on Atom](https://atom.io/packages/ria-word-randomizer).

You can also simply launch [Atom](https://atom.io/), go to `File > Settings`, choose the `Install` tab and simply search for `ria-word-randomizer`.
